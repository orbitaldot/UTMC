This is a mod for Undertale v1.08 that I threw together in order to properly learn [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) and to explore the extent of what is possible with it.  
Essentially, it's an experimental attempt at using Undertale's RPG "engine" for a sandbox mining game.

## Installation

Download "UTMC.zip" from the latest release to follow the instructions.

1. Open DeltaPatcherLite.exe (included in the zip file)
2. For "Original File", pick the data.win file of your UNDERTALE installation (which, on Windows, should be in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Undertale`).
3. For "XDelta patch", choose "UTMC.XDelta" from this download.
4. Click "Apply Patch" and let the patcher do its thing.

## Features

- Infinite (?) terrain with chunk saving/loading
- Breakable tiles
- Item amounts
- Dynamite
- Explosions
- Dynamite Explosions
- Minecarts and Rails
- A super cool-looking lava effect
- Sparkly crystals

There is no goal/engame.


## Known issues

- Minecarts & rails like to misbehave sometimes.
- The camera lags behind when the screen is shaking.
- While the mod allows you to start regular Undertale, the item amount system may render the game unplayable. I'm thinking of turning the item amount system into an own - stand-alone mod, compatible with the normal game.
- Existing minecarts aren't saved when the game closes. Always make sure to break your carts after using them.
